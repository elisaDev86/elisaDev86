Hi, I'm Elisa, a junior frontend developer. I studied Html, Css, Js, React js and various libraries like Bootstrap, Tailwind and Styled Components. Currently I'm also studying the Dart language and the related Flutter because I'd like to delve into the world of mobile development. I really like studying and always being updated to improve myself and grow in this wonderful profession.
